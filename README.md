# Ship-Shooter
An Asteroids-like shooter on the high seas!

## About
Ship-Shooter changes the fundamental movement and attacks of your ship, and takes you down from the stratosphere back down to the seas, though certainly not to the mundane, with monsters, obstacles and even pirates determined to see you sunk.

### Note
This may be slightly based on the Space Shooter Unity tutorial, and assets are gradually being replaced with our own original ones.
